# Project01_ML
## Who I got help from
- ### I got help from my sci-learn for helping me to learn sklearn, I also used chatgpt and Flint to problem solve through problems that I encountered. One example of these such problems would be what possible models are there and what is the benefit to each of them, and then also learning skew and standard deviation for the quantile regressor. I also got my data from nfl savnt from this link https://nflsavant.com/about.php
## How to run the program
- ### Since there is no input of text into the function, you can either input the starting conditions of the drive into the simulation file at the method in the bottom, though I found that using the jupyter notebook to just run it is easier. To choose the teams, you will have to use the team's three letter abbreviation.(Ex. CAR for the carolina panthers)
## What is the next step
- ### Beyond this project I want to make the singular drives into and actual full game that will allow me to get a winner. and as such by running many of those simulations, I will be able to find the percentage of one team winning opposed to another based on how many times they won out of the simulations.
